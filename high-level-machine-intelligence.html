<h1>6 High-level machine intelligence</h1>
<!--
BZ: Do you think we should write a brief paragraph here about high-level machine intelligence so the average reader can understand what we are talking about? 
-->
<div id="arrivesooner" class="section level2">
<h2>6.1 The public think high-level machine intelligence will arrive sooner than AI experts predict</h2>
<!--
BZ: This subsection is pretty solid -- about 95% there. Could you check to make sure that the language in the main text is not too technical for the average reader to understand? 
MA: to BZ to AD Most important substantive thing I think should change is how we deal with the HMLI timelines. My view is that we should not be making the comparison at all. 

Currently, we've removed the direct comparison from the Key Findings, but we still make the comparison in the heading above as well as by including the two expert predictions and the predictions from our survey in the same graph. However, this is very likely to be taken out of context, e.g. by someone just clipping out the graph. Because of this, I don't think it's enough to simply write in the text or a footnote that the questions were very different. If the comparison isn't solid enough to include in the key findings, it's not solid enough to include in this heading or the graph. 

The comparison is not solid enough, according to me. The questions are very different. It may well be the case that people aren't able to differentiate the questions and we'd get the same timeline from the public if we'd asked them the expert survey question. But I only think we should claim that if we can back it up with data, rather than just intuition. 

Concretely, I'd suggest:
* Not having the expert prediction and the public prediction in the same graph.
* Not making the comparison in the heading above.
* Mention the difference in predictions in the text below, with strong caveats that the two predictions may not be comparable. 
-->
<p>Respondents were asked to <a href="apptopline.html#forecasthlmi">forecast when high-level machine intelligence will be developed</a>. High-level machine intelligence was defined as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say we have high-level machine intelligence when machines are able to perform almost all tasks that are economically relevant today better than the median human (today) at each task. Note that this would include subtle common sense queries such as a travel agent would provide. Ignore tasks which are legally or culturally restricted to humans, such as being a jury member.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents were asked to predict the probability that high-level machine intelligence will be built in 10, 20, and 50 years.</p>
<p>We present our survey results in two ways. First, we show the summary statistics in a simple table. Next, to compare the public’s forecasts with forecasts made by AI researchers in 2016 <span class="citation">(Grace et al. <a href="#ref-grace2018will">2018</a>)</span>, we aggregated the respondents’ forecasts using the same method. Note that <span class="citation">Grace et al. (<a href="#ref-grace2018will">2018</a>)</span> asked about a much higher definition of high-level machine intelligence involving machines being better than all humans at all tasks.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Respondents predict that high-level machine intelligence will arrive fairly quickly. Respondents predict a median probability of 54% by 2028, a median probability of 70% by 2038, and a median probability of 88% by 2068.</p>
<p>These predictions are considerably higher than predictions by experts in two previous surveys. In <span class="citation">Müller and Bostrom (<a href="#ref-muller2014future">2014</a>)</span>, expert respondents predict a 50% probability of high-level human intelligence being developed by 2040 and 90% by 2075. In <span class="citation">Grace et al. (<a href="#ref-grace2018will">2018</a>)</span>, experts predict that there is a 50% chance that high-level machine intelligence will be built by 2061. Plotting the public’s forecast with the expert forecast from <span class="citation">Grace et al. (<a href="#ref-grace2018will">2018</a>)</span>, we see that the public predicts high-level machine intelligence arriving much sooner than experts forecast. Employing the same aggregation method used in <span class="citation">Grace et al. (<a href="#ref-grace2018will">2018</a>)</span>, Americans predict that there is a 50% chance that high-level machine intelligence will be developed by 2026.</p>
<p>Results in <span class="citation">Walsh (<a href="#ref-walsh2018expert">2018</a>)</span> also show that the non-experts (i.e., readers of a news article about AI) are more optimistic in their predictions of high-level machine intelligence compared with experts. While nearly 80% of non-experts think that high-level machine intelligence will be built by 2050, only 40% of experts predict that. In our survey, respondents with CS or engineering degrees give a somewhat longer timeline for the arrival of high-level machine intelligence. Nevertheless, these respondents’ forecasts are more optimistic than those made by experts from <span class="citation">Grace et al. (<a href="#ref-grace2018will">2018</a>)</span> and show considerable overlap with the overall public forecast. In fact, this subgroup predicts that there is a 50% chance that human-level-machine intelligence will be developed by 2029.</p>
<p>Our results are robust to a different definition of advanced AI. In a pilot survey conducted on Mechanical Turk during July 13-14, 2017, we asked American respondents about human-level AI, defined as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human-level artificial intelligence (human-level AI) refers to computer systems that can operate with the intelligence of an average human being. These programs can complete tasks or make decisions as successfully as the average human can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this pilot study, respondents also provided forecasts that are more optimistic than the projections by AI experts. The respondents predict a median probability of 44% by 2027, a median probability of 62% by 2037, and a median probability of 83% by 2067.</p>

<h2>6.2 Americans express mixed support for developing high-level machine intelligence</h2>
<!--
BZ: I think this subsection is pretty solider -- about 95% there.
-->
<p>Respondents were asked how much they <a href="apptopline.html#supporthlmi">support or oppose the development of high-level machine intelligence</a>. Similar to the results about support for developing AI, Americans express mixed support for the development of high-level machine intelligence. About one-third of Americans (32%) somewhat or strongly support the development of AI while 27% somewhat or strongly oppose the development of AI. Many express a neutral attitude: 29% state that they neither support nor oppose while 12% indicate they don’t know.</p>
<p>The correlation between support for developing AI and support for developing high-level machine intelligence is 0.62. The mean level of support for developing AI, compared with the mean level of support for developing high-level machine intelligence, is 0.24 points (MOE = +/- 0.06) higher on a five-point scale (two-sided <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0.001\)</span>).</p>

<h2>6.3 Men, partisans, high-income Americans, and those with tech experience express greater support for high-level machine intelligence</h2>
<!--
BZ: I think this section is 90% there. One thing that I cannot explain is why partisans express higher support for HLMI. 

I also ran another regression where I included support for AI as a predictor variable and reported the interesting results. 
-->
<p>Support for developing high-level machine intelligence varies greatly between demographic subgroups, although only a minority in each subgroup support developing the technology. Some of the demographic trends we observe regarding support for developing AI also holds here: men, high-income Americans, and those with tech experience express greater support for high-level machine intelligence.</p>
<p>We used a multiple regression that includes all of the demographic variables to predict support for developing high-level machine intelligence. The support for developing AI outcome variable had been standardized, so it has mean 0 and unit variance.</p>
<p>Significant predictors correlated with support for developing high-level machine intelligence include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying as a Democrat or a Republican (versus identifying as an Independent)</li>
<li>Having a family income of more than $100,000 annually (versus having a family income of less than $30,000 annually)</li>
<li>Having CS or programming experience (versus not having such experience)</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a female (versus being a male) is the only significant predictor of opposition to developing high-level machine intelligence.</p>
<p>We also performed the analysis above but <a href="addresults.html#appsupporthlmi">controlling for respondents’ support for developing AI</a>. Doing so allows us to identify subgroups those attitudes toward AI diverges from their attitudes toward high-level machine intelligence. In this secondary analysis, we find that being 69 or older is a significant predictor of <em>support</em> for developing high-level machine intelligence. In contrast, having a four-year college degree is a significant predictor of <em>opposition</em> to developing high-level machine intelligence. We hypothesize that senior citizens are unconcerned about advanced workplace automation because they have retired; furthermore, seniors may welcome highly-capable robotic caretakers. On the other hand, college graduates could feel threatened by AI systems so advanced that the latter could perform the tasks typically done by high-skilled humans.</p>

<h2>6.4 The public expects high-level machine intelligence to be more harmful than good</h2>
<!-- 
BZ: My assessment is this subsection is pretty solid -- 95% there. I added results from another analysis where I took the expected value of the experts' responses so it's comparable to the public's responses. 
-->
<p>This question sought to quantify respondents’ <a href="apptopline.html#expectedoutcome">expected outcome of high-level machine intelligence</a>. Respondents were asked to consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that high-level machine intelligence could be developed one day. How positive or negative do you expect the overall impact of high-level machine intelligence to be on humanity in the long run?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Americans, on average, expect that high-level machine intelligence will have a harmful impact on balance. Of the 34% who think the technology will have a harmful impact, 12% said it could be extremely bad, leading to possible human extinction. More than a quarter of Americans think that high-level machine intelligence will be good for humanity, with 5% saying it will be extremely good. Since forecasting the impact of such technology on humanity is highly uncertain, 18% of respondents selected “I don’t know.” The correlation between one’s expected outcome and one’s support for developing high-level machine intelligence is 0.69.</p>
<p>A similar question was asked to AI experts in <span class="citation">Grace et al. (<a href="#ref-grace2018will">2018</a>)</span>; instead of simply selecting one expected outcome, the AI experts were asked to predict the likelihood of each outcome. In contrast to the general public, the expert respondents think that high-level machine intelligence will be more beneficial than harmful.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Although they assign, on average, a 27% probability of high-level machine intelligence of being extremely good for humanity, they also assign, on average, a 9% probability of the technology being extremely bad, including possibly causing human extinction.</p>
