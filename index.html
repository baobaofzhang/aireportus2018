<h1>1 Overview: AI and American public opinion</h1>
<!--
BZ: This section is probably the most important. I recommend that you spend a lot of time to make sure it sounds right to you.
My assessment: It's about 90% there.

AD: Exec summary:
-I have a few small edits will add Tuesday night (on my other laptop, which I left at airport!)
-AD todo: add exec summary portion saying how AI is awesome, important to understand these perceptions and fears to prevent overreaction. 
-AD to add: note that in our view this raises more questions than it answers. It is clear that much more work needs to be done to understand… This is not perfect, doing subsequent waves will improve. 

-Baobao: explain somewhere at the top that results presented roughly in chronological order as presented to subjects. 

-Additional analyses, e.g. demographic predictors of timelines, or outcomes from HLMI (and comparison to earlier demographic analyses).

<!-- #is the public "one" voice? also, the public isn't a voice, it's the "public's"" voice.

<p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> could impact nearly all aspects of society: the labor market, transportation, healthcare, education, and national security. While discussions about AI and applications of machine learning among technologists and policymakers have expanded, the voices of the public have yet to enter these conversations. In this report, we seek to understand the American public’s attitudes toward AI and what they consider to be the most important policy challenges related to the technology. In the U.S., public opinion has shaped many policy conversations, including immigration, free trade, international conflicts, and climate change mitigation. While the technology industry and governments currently predominate policy conversations on AI, the authors expect the public to become more influential over time, as witnessed in other emerging policy domains. It is thus vital to have a better understanding of how the public thinks about the governance of AI. Such understanding is crucial for informed policy-making efforts, as well as in identifying opportunities for educating the public about AI’s character, benefits, and risks.</p>
<p>The survey covers a wide range of topics in AI governance, including workplace automation; attitudes regarding international cooperation; the public’s trust of various actors to develop and regulate AI; and historical and cross-national trends in public opinion regarding AI.</p>
<p>This report is based on findings from a nationally representative survey conducted by the Governance of AI Program at the University of Oxford using the survey firm YouGov. The survey was conducted between June 6 and June 14, 2018, with a total of 2,000 American adults (18+) completing the survey. The analysis of this survey was <a href="https://osf.io/7gqvm/">pre-registered on the Open Science Framework</a>. <a href="appmethod.html#appmethod">Appendix A</a> provides further details regarding the data collection and analysis process.</p>
<p>We plan to regularly release similar reports based on our survey research in the U.S., China, and the European Union (EU). We welcome collaborators on future surveys.</p>
<!-- AD assessment: the above looks pretty good! Let's have Markus try his hand at tightening it. -->
<div id="key-findings" class="section level2">
<h2>1.1 Key findings</h2>
<!-- MA: Changed things around a bit above. Biggest changes:
- Changing the last bit of the first paragraph. I made the previous two points into one.
- I moved up the description of what the report includes
- I added a sentence on our pre-registration. That's pretty awesome 
- To BZ: Is it true that we're looking at "cross-national trands in public opinion regarding AI"? To me that sounds like us comparing either between or within countries, something I'm not seeing us do. 
- BZ to MA: We compared the US results to the EU results. 
-->
<!--
BZ: I re-wrote the key findings to include concrete numbers that people could cite. A few things that I have not include/reasons why I did not include them. 
- Americans do not consider a lot of applications that use ML or AI to be applications of AI. (Hard to summarize the results in one sentence; also the results are driven by inattention.)
- Americans think China is slightly ahead on AI R&D. (Might cause the wrong headlines.)
- Demographic predictors of support for high-level machine intelligence. (Similar to the demographics breakdown of support for developing AI.)
     -AD: This seems worth noting to me. 
    -AD: Also, what about gender? To me the gender result is an important one, re HLMI, to argue contra pinker and others.
    [BZ: I added that bit.]
    [MA: I don't see gender added]

My assesment: It's about 90% there. I want to make sure that we have highlighted all the interesting and important results. 
-->
<p>Below we highlight key findings from our survey<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More Americans support than oppose developing AI. After reading a short explanation, a substantial minority of Americans (41%) support developing AI while a smaller minority (22%) oppose developing AI.</p></li>
<li><p>Demographic subgroups that indicate the greatest support for developing AI include college graduates, those with high income, or those with a tech background.</p></li>
<li><p>The overwhelming majority of Americans (82%) agree that robots and/or AI should be carefully managed. This figure is comparable with survey results from EU respondents.</p></li>
<li><p>Americans consider all the AI governance challenges presented in the survey to be important for governments and tech companies to manage carefully. Governance challenges perceived to be the most likely to impact Americans within the next decade <em>and</em> rated the highest in issue importance were<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Protecting data privacy</li>
<li>Preventing AI cyber attacks against governments, companies, organizations, and individuals</li>
<li>Preventing AI-assisted surveillance from violating privacy and civil liberties</li>
<li>Preventing AI from being used to spread fake and harmful content online</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>University researchers and the U.S. military are the groups most trusted to develop AI: about half of Americans express a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of confidence in these actors to develop AI. In regard to <em>managing</em> the development and use of AI, Americans place greater trust in tech companies and non-governmental organizations (e.g., OpenAI), compared with federal or state governments.</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
OLD: Americans do not have a great deal of confidence in the U.S. government, international organizations, corporations or other actors to develop or manage AI in the best interest of the public. The U.S. military and university researchers are perceived to be the most trusted groups to build AI. In contrast, the public places the most trust in the Partnership on AI and non-governmental scientific organizations to _manage_ the development and use of AI.

Can we summarize this in a different way? "do not have a great deal" sounds like not have much. To be more precise, would way say something like only X% have "a fair amount" of confidence, and Y% a "great deal", with the rest having "not too much" or "no" confidence in....  

This "in contrast" is confusing, since it's not clear where the contrast comes from, and implies the contrast is data driven. Maybe public would trust military the most to develop as well. . I recommend we just combine build and develop questions. Suggested text:
Broadly, the public's trust in organizations can be divided into five tiers: 
(1) The U.S. military and university researchers. (~1.55, OR SOME OTHER SUMMARY STAT LIKE PERCENTAGE THAT TRUST FAIR AMOUNT OR GREAT DEAL)
(2) Tech companies (excluding Facebook), scientific organizations, and the Partnership on AI (~SUMMARY)
(3) US intelligence organizations, NATO.
(4) international organizations and the UN (SUMMARY).
(5) Facebook. 

OR MAYBE HERE WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING A BIT MORE CONCISE. Like combine (2) and (3)

FOR LATER TEXT ON THIS PLEASE NOTE for the future we will only ask one version of this question, and that comparing across these question types is not ideal. 

[BZ: I rewrote the bullet point above. I took out the "contrast" bit.]
[MA: I added "(e.g. OpenAI)" as this seems important to make clear to people what we were asking. When I read the sentence without it, I think of e.g. Amnesty, not OpenAI or PAI]
-->

<li><p>Americans express mixed support for the U.S. investing more in AI military capabilities <em>and</em> of cooperating with China to avoid the dangers of an AI arms race. Providing respondents with information about the risks of a U.S.-China AI arms race decreases support for the U.S. investing more in AI military capabilities. In contrast, providing a pro-nationalist message or a message about AI’s threat to humanity fail to affect Americans’ policy preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>The median respondent predicts that there is a 54% chance that high-level machine intelligence will be developed by 2028. We define <em>high-level machine intelligence</em> as when machines are able to perform almost all tasks that are economically relevant today better than the median human (today) at each task. See <a href="apptopline.html#forecasthlmi">Appendix B</a> for a detailed definition.</p></li>

<p><!-- These aren't comparable!!  Remember, totally different questions. Unless I'm missing something, this seems like a pretty huge mis-statement, and makes me concerned that the rest of the report has substantial errors.
[BZ: I deleted the comparison.]
[MA: I'd suggest changing to "54% chance by 2028" instead of extrapolating from their responses to what the implied likelihood at 2026 would be. Seems like a more accurate way to represent the results to me.]
[BZ: Thanks! I changed it to be the ]

<ul>
<li><p>Americans express mixed support for developing high-level machine intelligence. Nearly a third of Americans support while 27% oppose the development of the technology.</p></li>
<li><p>Demographic subgroups that express the greatest support for developing high-level machine intelligence include men, college graduates, those with high income, or those with a tech background.</p></li>
<li><p>There are more Americans who think that high-level machine intelligence will be harmful than those who believe it will be beneficial to humanity. Twenty-two percent think the technology will be “on balance bad,” and 12% that it would be “extremely bad,” leading to possible human extinction. By contrast, 21% think it will be “on balance good,” and 5% think it will be “extremely good.”</p></li>

AD:Ok, so for future waves I think we should change this. :) 
The median human today at any particular task probably sucks at the task. Like, I suck at sewing. 
Instead, we should ask about the humans currently employed to performan that task. eg "as when machines are able to perform almost all tasks that are economically relevant today better than the median human (today) employed to perform that task."
Problem with this definition is it will change over time, it will get "higher". 
I doubt these nuances matter. In future waves we should always randomly assign the old definition, to check if it generates similar results. 
[BZ: I have added this to our document of future to-dos.]
